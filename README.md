# UNO Card Game Score Keeper

This is a simple score keeper for the UNO card game. It is a console application that allows you to keep track of the scores of the players in the game and save the state of the game to a file.  I built this for fun to help me refresh my Python skills.

## Getting Started

To run the program, simply download the `uno_scorekeeper.py` file and the `unogame.py` file and run it using Python 3.
```bash
python uno_scorekeeper.py
```

## Testing

To run the tests, simply run the `test_unogame.py` file or the `test_unoscorekeeper.py` using Python 3.
```bash
python -m unittest test_unoscorekeeper.py
```
